You can create a cell phone blocker using a Raspberry Pi by following these steps:

1.Connect a USB GPS module to the Raspberry Pi.

2.Install and configure a GPS daemon software to receive GPS signals and make the data available to other software programs.

3.Install a software program that can detect and identify cell phone signals and their corresponding frequencies.

4.Write a Python script that uses the GPS data to determine the location of the Raspberry Pi and the cell phone signal detection software to identify any nearby cell phone signals.

5.Have the script control a relay that is connected to the Raspberry Pi and use it to switch an RF jammer on and off to block the identified cell phone signals.

Note: It is illegal to use a cell phone jammer in many countries, without proper authorization from the government. Please check the laws in your area before proceeding with this project.
